# Climate Inventory

This repository contains several scrapers that pull relevant data for the Green House Gas Emissions Inventory for the City of Long Beach. We also include the `streamlit_app.py` file that contains the streamlit app that allows the user to run the scrapers and download the data.

## Scrapers

The scrapers are located in the `src/extrations` folder. There, there are several scrapers that pull data from different sources. The scrapers are:

**California Air Resources Board (CARB)** 


**EMFAC** 


**Environmental Protection Agency - FLIGHT App (EPAFlight)**


**Environmental Protection Agency - Hub**


**Google - Environmental Insights Explorer (GoogleEIE)**


**US Census (USCensus)**
